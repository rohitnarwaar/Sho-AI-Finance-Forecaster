## 🎯 Assignment Implementation Notes
This project has been built to meet and exceed the requirements for the **Finance Dashboard UI** evaluation. 

**How Core Requirements are Met:**
1. **Dashboard Overview:** Displays multiple active components including Net Worth Area charts, Debt Freedom trackers, AI insight text blocks, and Categorical Spending ML Clusters.
2. **Transactions Section:** Includes a robust list of recent transactions mapped directly from Firebase. **Includes full Search, Category Filtering, and Value Sorting.**
3. **Role-Based UI:** At the top navigation bar, there is a **Role Switcher** dropdown. Toggling it from Admin to Viewer immediately disables the "Add Transaction" button, the "Set Budget" inputs, the "Simulator", and "Create Goal" features.
4. **Insights Section:** Uses Google Gemini (via Python backend) to provide incredibly deep portfolio insights. Also includes daily streaks and goal tracking.
5. **State Management:** Uses React Context (`AuthContext`) for global user state and Firebase Real-Time Listeners (`onSnapshot`) for instant UI updates when data changes across devices.
6. **Optional Enhancements Included:** Live Database Persistence (Firestore), AI API Integration, Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering), and Premium Framer Motion Animations.
